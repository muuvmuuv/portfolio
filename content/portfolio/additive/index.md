Sleep in the bathroom sink allways wanting food. Rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent intently sniff hand intrigued by the shower, but hide from vacuum cleaner yet i see a bird i stare at it i meow at it i do a wiggle come here birdy, eat a plant, kill a hand prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark. Throw down all the stuff in the kitchen white cat sleeps on a black shirt the cat was chasing the mouse meowing chowing and wowing. I’m so hungry i’m so hungry but ew not for that try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard decide to want nothing to do with my owner
