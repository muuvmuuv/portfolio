## Code blocks

```jsx{numberLines: true}
import { Component } from 'react'

class Test extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // do something on mount here
  }

  // highlight-start
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Test {this.props.test}</h1>
        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: this.props.html }} />
      </>
    )
  }
  // highlight-end
}

export default Test
```

```
Some basic preformated text block
    funny how easy that
                is
```

```bash{outputLines: 3-7}
